        <p><span>PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.</span></p>
        <p><span>2 </span><em><span>O</span></em><span> </span><em><span>my</span></em><span>
          </span><em><span>soul</span></em><span>, thou hast said unto the Lord, Thou
          </span><em><span>art</span></em><span> my
            Lord: my goodness </span><em><span>extendeth</span></em><span> not to thee;</span></p>
        <p><span>3 </span><em><span>But</span></em><span> to the saints that </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> in
            the
            earth, and </span><em><span>to</span></em><span> the excellent, in whom
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> all my
            delight.</span></p>
        <p><span>4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> hasten
          </span><em><span>after</span></em><span> another </span><em><span>god:</span></em><span> their drink offerings
            of
            blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</span></p>
        <p><span>5 The Lord </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou
            maintainest my lot.</span></p>
        <p><span>6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant </span><em><span>places;</span></em><span> yea, I have a
            goodly
            heritage.</span></p>
        <p><span>7 I will bless the Lord, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night
            seasons.</span></p>
        <p><span>8 I have set the Lord always before me: because </span><em><span>he</span></em><span>
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> at my right hand, I shall not be moved.</span></p>
        <p><span>9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.</span></p>
        <p><span>10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see
            corruption.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> fulness of
            joy; at
            thy right hand </span><em><span>there</span></em><span> </span><em><span>are</span></em><span> pleasures for
            evermore.</span></p>

        <p><span>To the chief Musician, </span><em><span>A</span></em><span> </span><em><span>Psalm</span></em><span> of
            David,
            the servant of the Lord, who spake unto the Lord the words of this song in the day
          </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the
            hand of
            Saul: And he said,</span></p>
        <p><span>I WILL love thee, O Lord, my strength.</span></p>
        <p><span>2 The Lord </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my
            strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation,
          </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> my
            high tower.</span></p>
        <p><span>3 I will call upon the Lord, </span><em><span>who</span></em><span>
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span>
          </span><em><span>worthy</span></em><span> to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</span></p>
        <p><span>4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</span></p>
        <p><span>5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</span></p>
        <p><span>6 In my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple,
            and my cry
            came before him, </span><em><span>even</span></em><span> into his ears.</span></p>
        <p><span>7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because
            he was
            wroth.</span></p>
        <p><span>8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by
            it.</span></p>
        <p><span>9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> under
            his
            feet.</span></p>
        <p><span>10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</span></p>
        <p><span>11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him
          </span><em><span>were</span></em><span> dark
            waters </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> thick clouds of the skies.</span></p>
        <p><span>12 At the brightness </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> </span><em><span>was</span></em><span>
            before him
            his thick clouds passed, hail </span><em><span>stones</span></em><span> and coals of fire.</span></p>
        <p><span>13 The Lord also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail
          </span><em><span>stones</span></em><span> and coals of fire.</span></p>
        <p><span>14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited
            them.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy
            rebuke, O
            Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</span></p>
        <p><span>16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</span></p>
        <p><span>17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for
            me.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the Lord was my stay.</span></p>
        <p><span>19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</span></p>
        <p><span>20 The Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he
            recompensed me.</span></p>
        <p><span>21 For I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</span></p>
        <p><span>22 For all his judgments </span><em><span>were</span></em><span> before me, and I did not put away his
            statutes
            from me.</span></p>
        <p><span>23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</span></p>
        <p><span>24 Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of
            my hands
            in his eyesight.</span></p>
        <p><span>25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself
            upright;</span></p>
        <p><span>26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself
            froward.</span></p>
        <p><span>27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</span></p>
        <p><span>28 For thou wilt light my candle: the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.</span></p>
        <p><span>29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</span></p>
        <p><span>30 </span><em><span>As</span></em><span> </span><em><span>for</span></em><span> God, his way
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span>
            a buckler to all those that trust in him.</span></p>
        <p><span>31 For who </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> God save the Lord? or who
          </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> a rock save our God?</span></p>
        <p><span>32 </span><em><span>It</span></em><span> </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> God that girdeth me with
            strength, and maketh my way perfect.</span></p>
        <p><span>33 He maketh my feet like hinds’ </span><em><span>feet</span></em><span>, and setteth me upon my high
            places.</span></p>
        <p><span>34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</span></p>
        <p><span>35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy
            gentleness hath made me great.</span></p>
        <p><span>36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</span></p>
        <p><span>37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were
            consumed.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</span></p>
        <p><span>39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up
            against
            me.</span></p>
        <p><span>40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>41 They cried, but </span><em><span>there</span></em><span> </span><em><span>was</span></em><span> none
            to save
          </span><em><span>them:</span></em><span> </span><em><span>even</span></em><span> unto the Lord, but he
            answered them
            not.</span></p>
        <p><span>42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the
            streets.</span></p>
        <p><span>43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> thou
            hast
            made me the head of the heathen: a people </span><em><span>whom</span></em><span> I have not known shall
            serve
            me.</span></p>
        <p><span>44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto
            me.</span></p>
        <p><span>45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</span></p>
        <p><span>46 The Lord liveth; and blessed </span><em><span>be</span></em><span> my rock; and let the God of my
            salvation
            be exalted.</span></p>
        <p><span>47 </span><em><span>It</span></em><span> </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> God that avengeth me,
            and
            subdueth the people under me.</span></p>
        <p><span>48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me:
            thou hast
            delivered me from the violent man.</span></p>
        <p><span>49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy
            name.</span>
        </p>
        <p><span>50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his
            seed for
            evermore.</span></p>

        <p><span>A Psalm of David, when he was in the wilderness of Judah.</span></p>
        <p><span>O GOD, thou </span><em><span>art</span></em><span> my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth
            for thee,
            my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;</span></p>
        <p><span>2 To see thy power and thy glory, so </span><em><span>as</span></em><span> I have seen thee in the
            sanctuary.</span></p>
        <p><span>3 Because thy lovingkindness </span><em><span>is</span></em><span> better than life, my lips shall
            praise
            thee.</span></p>
        <p><span>4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.</span></p>
        <p><span>5 My soul shall be satisfied as </span><em><span>with</span></em><span> marrow and fatness; and my
            mouth shall
            praise </span><em><span>thee</span></em><span> with joyful lips:</span></p>
        <p><span>6 When I remember thee upon my bed, </span><em><span>and</span></em><span> meditate on thee in the
          </span><em><span>night</span></em><span> watches.</span></p>
        <p><span>7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.</span></p>
        <p><span>8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.</span></p>
        <p><span>9 But those </span><em><span>that</span></em><span> seek my soul, to destroy
          </span><em><span>it</span></em><span>, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</span></p>
        <p><span>10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.</span></p>
        <p><span>11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them
            that
            speak lies shall be stopped.</span></p>
